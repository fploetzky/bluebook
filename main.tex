	We start with a longer paragraph to check the indention at the end of the paragraph.
	This particular check can hardly be done by using blindtext, so I have to image a few lines to write. And of course, like every time doing this, I have no idea what to write so don't bother reading this.
	
	It's just to see the indention right before this sentence. And of course the following blindtext will also show an indention. But that is not really important to mention.

	And now to something completely different.\footnote{This is an endnote.}
